# Heart Disease Risk Prediction

An end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict the risk of chronic heart disease. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training (using Random Forest), hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and deployment via a simple Flask web application.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, scaling, and data splitting.
- **Model Training:** Uses a Random Forest Classifier with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
- **Evaluation:** Comprehensive metrics including accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Web Application:** User-friendly Flask app to make predictions interactively.
- **Reproducible:** Fully containerized dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
